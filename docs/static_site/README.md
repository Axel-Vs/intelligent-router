# Static Site for GitHub Pages

This folder is for static hosting only. You can copy your web/index.html and any required CSS/JS/images here for GitHub Pages deployment.

- Do NOT move or change your main project structure.
- Only copy files you want to be visible as a static site.

## How to use
1. Copy your static files (e.g., from `web/`) into this folder.
2. Push to GitHub.
3. In your repo settings, set GitHub Pages source to `/docs/static_site` on the `main` branch.

Your static site will be available at:
`https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/`

*This folder is safe to delete or ignore if you do not want a static site.*
